* Hey there! I'm currently working as an R&D and Special Projects Assistant at **Wonderfeel** , a San Francisco-based Neutraceutical Biosciences Start-up. My job involves doing research for new formulations and patents, analyzing new ingredients, and handling various startup matters. It's a really exciting and dynamic environment, and I love being a part of such an innovative company.

* I graduated from **Bilkent University** in Summer 2022 with a **B.Sc. in Molecular Biology and Genetics**. Since then, I've become really interested in Longevity, particularly Cellular Aging and the science behind it. I've been trying to integrate Longevity practices into my daily routine to improve my cellular health and live a longer, healthier life.

* Before joining **Wonderfeel**, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at **Ankara University Biotechnology Institute** from Oct 2020 to Sep 2022, where I investigated apoptotic effects of biomolecules on Ovarian Cancer and analyzed the effects on mRNA scale. 

* I've also had the opportunity to work as a Research Intern at the University of Seville Genetics Department, where I explored the regulation of the biosynthesis of carotenoids. 

* I worked as a Research Intern at Ankara University Biotechnology Institute, where I focused on developing effective drug candidate molecules from biological organisms for the treatment of breast cancer.

* Overall, I'm passionate about scientific research and always looking for ways to innovate and push boundaries.
